# My Note's
#### A few notes on Markdown
* Formatting files with Markdown
  * Headings: Similar to htmls heading 1 to heading 6, we can recreate them in Markdown using the following
  * `h1 = # `, `h2 = ##`, `h3 = ###` and so on.
* Previewing changes in VS Code
  * In VS Code, `open preview to the side` button allows to preview the markdown in real time.
* Links: In Markdown, we can create link using the following markdown syntax `[Link Text](URL)`, like so! Following is an example:  
  * [Google](www.google.com) for your searchengine needs!
* Creating a table of contents using Lists
  * To create table of contents, similar to html we can have 2 types of table or list.
    * unordered or bulleted list (similar to `ul` tag)
    * ordered list
  * to create and unordered list we use `*` asterisk and nest it as much as necessary to created an unordered list
  * to create an ordered list, we just simply user numbers like the following
    1. This is an example
    2. ordered list
    3. we just used numbers instead of asterisk
* `Syntax Highlighting: ` In order to highlight the syntax in markdown, we simply use tha backtick(`) around the word or sentence that we need to highlight.
